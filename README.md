# Logz.io Detection as Code

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow for automatically deploying security rules to Logz.io.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
.github/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-logzio-rules.yml    # Main workflow file

logzio-rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security/                       # Security rules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ suspicious-activity.json
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions):

#### Required Secrets:
- `LOGZIO_API_TOKEN` - Production Logz.io API token


### 2. Get Your Logz.io API Token

1. Log in to your Logz.io account
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Manage tokens** ‚Üí **API tokens**
3. Click **+ New API token**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "GitHub Actions Deployment")
5. Select the appropriate permissions:
   - For security rules: `Security - Read` and `Security - Write`
6. Copy the token and add it to GitHub Secrets

## üìù Rule File Format

### Security Rules

Security rules should be placed in `logzio-rules/security/` as JSON files.

## üîÑ Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered by:

1. **Push to main/master branch** - Automatically deploys rules when changes are pushed to rule files
2. **Pull requests** - Validates rule files without deploying
3. **Manual trigger** - Deploy on-demand with environment selection via Actions tab

## üéØ Workflow Features

### ‚úÖ Automatic Features
- **Validation** - Validates JSON/YAML syntax before deployment
- **Idempotency** - Updates existing rules or creates new ones based on title
- **Multi-environment support** - Deploy to different environments (prod/staging/dev)
- **Error handling** - Continues with other rules if one fails

### üìä Deployment Process
1. **Validate** - Check all rule files for valid JSON/YAML syntax
2. **Deploy Security Rules** - Deploy all files in `logzio-rules/security/`


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Adding a New Alert Rule

1. Create a new JSON file in `logzio-rules/security/`:
```bash
touch logzio-rules/security/cobaltstrike-usage.json
```
2. Add your rule configuration
3. Commit and push:
```bash
git add logzio-rules/security/cobaltstrike-usage.json
git commit -m "Add Cobalt Strike usage alert rule"
git push origin main
```

### Manual Deployment

1. Go to Actions tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select "Deploy Security Rules" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Testing Rules in Pull Request

1. Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b add-new-alerts
```

2. Add or modify rules
3. Create a pull request
4. The workflow will validate your rules without deploying

## üîç Monitoring Deployments

### Check Workflow Status
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
- Click on the workflow run to see detailed logs
- Each step shows success ‚úÖ or failure ‚ùå status

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized**: Check if API token is correctly set in GitHub Secrets
2. **404 Not Found**: Verify the API endpoint URL and region configuration
3. **400 Bad Request**: Validate your rule JSON structure
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between deployments if deploying many rules

### Debug Tips

- Check workflow logs in the Actions tab
- Validate JSON locally: `jq . logzio-rules/security-rules/my-rule.json`
- Test API manually with curl:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-API-TOKEN: your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.logz.io/v2/alerts
```
